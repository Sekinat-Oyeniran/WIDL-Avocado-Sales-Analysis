ðŸ“Œ Project Title

WIDL Avocado Sales Analysis Using Excel


ðŸ“Œ Project Introduction

This project was undertaken as part of a technical data analysis task for a Data Analyst role at WIDL, a multinational supermarket chain. The task involves analyzing avocado sales data to uncover trends and generate actionable insights using Excel.

ðŸ“Œ Aim

To analyze weekly avocado sales data across various U.S. regions and provide insights that help WIDL understand sales performance, consumer behavior, and pricing impact.

ðŸ“Œ Data Source and Summary

- **Source:** WIDL-provided dataset (original), and [Kaggle â€“ Avocado Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices)

- **Content:** Weekly avocado sales from multiple U.S. regions between 2015 and 2018.

- **Structure:** OLAP-format dataset with attributes like `Date`, `Region`, `Type` (Conventional/Organic), `Total Bags`, and `AveragePrice`.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Excel workbook is structured into several sheets, each serving a specific purpose:

Q1â€“Q6 (Solutions): Each sheet provides clear, visual responses to the core business questions outlined in the task brief.

V1â€“V5: Individual visualizations focused on answering specific business questions (Q1â€“Q5).

Dashboard: An interactive summary with slicers and key visuals for exploring trends across time, region, avocado type, and price.

Clean_dataset: Contains the cleaned and pre-processed avocado sales dataset used for analysis.

Report: A structured textual breakdown of insights, trends, and strategic recommendations based on the visual findings.


ðŸ“Œ Methodology

Data Cleaning: Verified completeness, removed hidden rows/columns, and ensured consistent formatting.

Data Modeling: Used pivot tables and slicers for filtering across time, region, and avocado types.

Visualization: Created bar charts, pie charts, and column graphs to illustrate trends and comparisons.

Analysis: Answered four key business questions using interactive visuals and data-driven observations.


ðŸ“Œ Observations

Total demand peaked in 2017 but showed a sharp drop in 2018.

Total US, West, and South Central were the top regions in terms of avocado demand.

There is a significant demand difference between conventional and organic avocados.

Demand tends to drop as the average price increases, and vice versa.

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

Macro Trend: A growth trend from 2015â€“2017, followed by a sharp drop in 2018 (likely data inconsistency or market shift).

Top Region in 2018: Total US had the highest demand.

Conventional vs Organic: Conventional avocados dominate the market significantly.

Price vs Demand: Inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

The analysis highlights consumer preference for affordable and conventional avocados. Regional differences in demand provide an opportunity to tailor distribution strategies.

ðŸ“Œ Recommendations

Marketing: Launch targeted campaigns in low-demand regions to boost sales.

Distribution: Reallocate inventory to high-demand regions.

Product Focus: Prioritize conventional avocados in lower-performing areas.

Pricing Strategy: Keep prices competitive to maintain high demand.
