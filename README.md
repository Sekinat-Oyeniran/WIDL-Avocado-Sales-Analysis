ðŸ“Œ Project Title

WIDL Avocado Sales Analysis Using Excel


ðŸ“Œ Project Introduction

This project was undertaken as part of a technical data analysis task for a Data Analyst role at WIDL, a multinational supermarket chain. The task involves analyzing avocado sales data to uncover trends and generate actionable insights using Excel.

ðŸ“Œ Aim

To analyze weekly avocado sales data across various U.S. regions and provide insights that help WIDL understand sales performance, consumer behavior, and pricing impact.

ðŸ“Œ Data Source and Summary

- **Source:** WIDL-provided dataset (original), and [Kaggle â€“ Avocado Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices)

- **Content:** Weekly avocado sales from multiple U.S. regions between 2015 and 2018.

- **Structure:** OLAP-format dataset with attributes like `Date`, `Region`, `Type` (Conventional/Organic), `Total Bags`, and `AveragePrice`.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Excel workbook is structured into several sheets, each serving a specific purpose:

Q1â€“Q6 (Solutions): Each sheet provides clear, visual responses to the core business questions outlined in the task brief.

V1â€“V5: Individual visualizations focused on answering specific business questions (Q1â€“Q5).

Dashboard: An interactive summary with slicers and key visuals for exploring trends across time, region, avocado type, and price.

Clean_dataset: Contains the cleaned and pre-processed avocado sales dataset used for analysis.

Report: A structured textual breakdown of insights, trends, and strategic recommendations based on the visual findings.


ðŸ“Œ Methodology

Data Cleaning: Verified completeness, removed hidden rows/columns, and ensured consistent formatting.

Data Modeling: Used pivot tables and slicers for filtering across time, region, and avocado types.

Visualization: Created bar charts, pie charts, and column graphs to illustrate trends and comparisons.

Analysis: Answered four key business questions using interactive visuals and data-driven observations.


ðŸ“Œ Observations

* Peak demand occurred in 2017; demand dropped significantly in 2018
* Total US, West, and South Central showed consistently high demand
* Conventional avocados vastly outsold organic types
* Sales volume tends to decrease as average price increases

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

* Macro Trend: Steady growth from 2015â€“2017, followed by a sharp dip in 2018 (likely due to data incompleteness or market adjustment)
* Top Region (2018): Total US recorded the highest sales
* Conventional vs Organic: Conventional avocados dominate demand
* Price Sensitivity: An inverse relationship exists between price and demand

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

The analysis reveals strong consumer preference for conventional and affordable avocados. Regional demand disparities point to opportunities for more targeted product distribution and pricing adjustments.


ðŸ“Œ Recommendations

Marketing: Launch targeted campaigns in low-demand regions to boost sales.

Distribution: Reallocate inventory to high-demand regions.

Product Focus: Prioritize conventional avocados in lower-performing areas.

Pricing Strategy: Keep prices competitive to maintain high demand.
